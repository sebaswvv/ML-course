## Algos:
### Linear Regression:

What it is: A statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one independent variable by fitting a linear equation to observed data. <br>

Sample Use Case: Predicting house prices based on square footage. The square footage is the independent variable, and the house price is the dependent variable.

### Multiple Regression:

What it is: Similar to linear regression, but it involves two or more independent variables. <br>

Sample Use Case: Predicting a car's fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) using multiple variables like engine size, weight, and horsepower.
